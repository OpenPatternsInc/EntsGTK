This is a C++ GUI program that manipulates and analyzes Ents database files. The Explorer UI lets the user navigate an Ents hierarchy.

(openpatterns.net/ents#)

It consists of a user interface which displays lists of things in 3 different columns. The current focus will be in the center list. The left list is a group which contains the focus. The right list is an example of the focus. The center also has lists of things which are neither super or sub-groups of the focus, including "siblings" and entities with unknown relation to focus.


To compile on linux using gcc, cmake requires the g++ compiler and the gtkmm 3.0 GTK graphics library with C++ bindings.


Compilation instructions for Fedora 28:

1. Install g++ with "sudo dnf install gcc-c++"

2. Install gtkmm with "sudo dnf install gtkmm30-devel"

3. Clone project to your filesystem.

4. Navigate in the Terminal to the Directory containing CMakeLists.txt and run "cmake CMakeLists.txt".

5. Running "make" should then generate the executable file.
